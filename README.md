# scripts

Small scripts and applications to make managing some computer tasks quick and easy:

- autopull: make a folder, move or link to your repositories, and use this script to automatically pull new changes for each and everyone.
- basic_template: basic structure of my (very self-contained) scripts
- free_space: deletes or reduces old logs, cache files, thumbinails and trash can contents to have more disk space available.
- run_at: (Not functional still!) Takes a script and makes it so it runs at shutdown, reboot or start.
- update: automatic update for many package managers, to update everything in one order.
