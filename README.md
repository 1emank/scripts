# scripts

Small scripts and applications to make managing some computer tasks quick and easy:

- 1emank_logrotate: script to set the log rotation of the scripts in this repository that create logs
- autopull: make a folder, move your repositories or link them, and use this script to automatically pull new changes for each and everyone.
- basic_template: basic structure of my (very self-contained) scripts
- empty_file: script to periodically deplete files
- free_space: deletes or reduces old logs, cache files, thumbinails and trash can contents to have more disk space available.
- update: automatic update for many package managers, to update everything in one order.

## Future:
- run_at: Takes a script and makes it so it runs at shutdown, reboot or start.
