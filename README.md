# scripts

Small scripts and applications to make managing some computer tasks quick and
easy:

- autopull: make a folder, move or link to your repositories, and use
this script to automatically pull new changes for each and everyone.
(Very early and quick version, still functional though).
- free_space: deletes old logs, cache files, thumbinails and trash can
contents to have more disk space available.
- run_at: (Not functional still!) Takes a script and makes it so it runs
at shutdown, reboot or start.
- update: automatic update for many package managers, to update in one order.
